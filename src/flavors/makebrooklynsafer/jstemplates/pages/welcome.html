<h1>Have your say on capital budget requests for the Brooklyn CB6 district!</h1>

<p>Each year Community Boards establish and submit a prioritized list of budget requests for the Mayor, City Council and Borough President to consider when determining the City budget.</p>

<p>Give input today and help shape those requests.</p>

<p>The data from this project will be used to identify and justify sought-after Capital budget projects. Public input will help inform Community Board submissions.</p>
