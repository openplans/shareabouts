<h1>Capital budget requests for the Brooklyn CB6 district</h1>

<p>Citizens pay taxes with an expectation that those government funds will be used to improve facilities and services to their communities. Citizens also have the right to help determine how they would like those tax dollars spent by providing input to their local Community Boards.  Each year the Community Boards establish and submit a prioritized list of budget requests for the Mayor, City Council and Borough President to consider when determining the City budget.  Public input is necessary to ensure that new needs are identified and requests are justified.</p>

<h3>What is this map?</h3>
<p>This project will provide an ongoing mechanism for capturing ideas and suggestions from the public on where they believe City government ought to be spending and investing Capital budget dollars.  Public input is vital to ensuring that government spending is done in greater alignment with communities’ priorities and values. Ultimately, this project is intended to be a tool for increasing citizen participation, or the democratization, of the City’s budget process.</p>

<h3>How will data be used?</h3>
<p>The data from this project will be used to identify and justify sought-after Capital budget projects.  Public input will help inform Community Board submissions which will be factored into the decision-making process used by the Mayor, City Council and Borough President when proposing, negotiating and ultimately adopting a budget.  As the amount of public input increases, we would expect a corresponding increase in the degree of influence the public has in determining how tax dollars are spent.</p>
