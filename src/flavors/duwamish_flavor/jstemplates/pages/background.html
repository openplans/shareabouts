<h1>Background</h1>

<p>The Duwamish River is Seattle's only river, and is one of the most polluted waterways in the US. After 100 years of urban industrialization, it contains more than 40 toxic chemicals above safe limits for humans and the environment, including PCBs, dioxins, carcinogenic PAHs, and arsenic. Studies show that the low income communities living along the river have higher rates of heart disease, asthma, and other illnesses than other Seattle areas. It is also home to salmon, osprey, sea lions, and other creatures who face unsafe levels of contamination.</p>

<p>The history here is rich. The Duwamish Tribe lived along the shores of this river for over 10,000 years, since the last ice age, until they were removed by incoming settlers who came about a century and a half ago.</p>

<p>In 2001, the US Environmental Protection Agency declared the lower 5 miles of the Duwamish to be a superfund site, which mandates a cleanup paid by those responsible for the pollution. After more than a decade of public deliberation, the EPA came to a final decision in December 2014, and ordered a $345 million cleanup to take place over the next 17 years.</p>

<p>The responsible parties named so far are Boeing Manufacturing, King County, the City of Seattle, and the Port of Seattle, with several more expected to be named over the coming years.</p>

<p>We hope that 'Hey Duwamish' can be used as a community monitoring system to help ensure that the $345 million is well spent. We want to restore the health of our watershed to its maximum potential and highlight the progress being made through initiatives such as the <a href="http://murray.seattle.gov/murray-announces-funding-for-duwamish-river-community-projects">Duwamish Opportunity Fund</a>.</p>
