<h1>About</h1>

<p>Hello! You're looking at a demo of Shareabouts, a mapping project from <a
  href="http://openplans.org/civicworks">OpenPlans</a>.</p>

<p>Shareabouts is a simple web app for crowdsourced mapping. You can use it to
  collect public input on maps - for example, where should a new park be built?
  Which bus stops need a new shelter? People can put dots on the map, add
  comments, discuss other people's suggestions and share locations over social
  networks.</p>

<p>In this demo here, we're collecting info on good places to eat near our
  office. But you could use it for anything.</p>

<p>Read more about Shareabouts at <a
  href="http://shareabouts.org/">shareabouts.org</a>, or head to <a
  href="https://github.com/openplans/shareabouts/">Shareabouts on github</a>.
  The project is <a href="https://github.com/openplans/shareabouts/">open
  source</a>, and we welcome your involvement. You can run Shareabouts on
  DotCloud, Heroku, and similar.</p>

<p>Thanks for trying out Shareabouts!</p>
