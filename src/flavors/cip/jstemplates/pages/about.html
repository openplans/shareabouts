<h1>About San Diego Infrastructure Projects</h1>

This is a prototype of the San Diego CIP Citizen Engagement App.

This is your chance to support the infrastructure projects you think are most important in your neighborhood.

The projects are those that were identified by your community planning group in October 2012.

Click the X to close this screen and then zoom into your neighborhood. Clicking on a blue dot will give you a brief description of the project and a chance to Support This!

You can also add a comment. If you want to spread the word about a project, feel free to share it with the world via Twitter and Facebook.

This is a proof of concept (alpha is how programmers call it) so we have no way to monitor how many times you, your friends, your paid friends, and all your computers might click away and game the system. So while we will share the results with your community planning group they will recognize that the "Support This!" totals might not be a fair representation of neighborhood votes.

By the way, this is not affiliated with the City of San Diego in any way but they know that we are doing this. Next year, we will improve on this app and institute a security system so that the results will be more reliable.

In the meantime, please be thoughtful and please share this with your friends and neighbors. The more folks that participate the more we will learn and improve this app.

Also, don't forget to attend your local community planning group as they are developing new infrastructure recommendations. Meetings are being held from July to September. Find your planning group here: http://www.sandiego.gov/planning/community/cpg/agendas.shtml

This app is developed by the San Diego Brigade of Code for America on a volunteer effort.

Thanks for trying out San Diego CIP Citizen Engagement App and Shareabouts!
