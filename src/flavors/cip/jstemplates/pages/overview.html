<h1>About</h1>

<p>
This is a initial beta test of a San Diego CIP Citizen Engagement app.
</p><p>
This is your chance to support the infrastructure projects you think are most important in your neighborhood.
</p><p>
The projects are those that were identified by your community planning group in October 2012.
</p><p>
Click the X to close this screen and then zoom into your neighborhood. Clicking on a blue dot will give you a brief description of the project and a chance to Support This!
</p><p>
You can also add comments. If you want to spread the word about a project, feel free to share it with the world via Twitter or Facebook.
</p><p>
This is an early release of this app and so we are not attempting to control how many times you, your friends, your paid friends, and all your computers might click away and game the system. So while we will share the results and comments with the community planning group they will recognize that the "Support This!" totals might not be a fair representation of neighborhood votes.
</p><p>
This app is not directly affiliated with the City of San Diego in any way yet we are working with the Council Infrastructure Committee to help operationalize the <a href='http://www.sandiego.gov/planning/community/pdf/cpc/agendas/2013/draft.pdf'>Neighborhood input policy</a> by deploying this and other apps as pilot projects.
</p><p>
In the meantime, please be thoughtful and please share this with your friends and neighbors. Having many community members participate will help us to learn and improve this app.
</p><p>
You can attend your local community planning group as they are developing new infrastructure recommendations. Meetings are being held from July to September. <a href='http://www.sandiego.gov/planning/community/cpg/agendas.shtml'>Find your planning group here</a>
</p><p>
This app is developed by the <a href='http://codeforsandiego.org'>San Diego Brigade</a> of <a href='http://codeforamerica.org'>Code for America</a> and is a volunteer effort.

Thanks for trying out San Diego CIP Citizen Engagement app and Shareabouts!
